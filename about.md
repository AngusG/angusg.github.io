![Angus](../img/nyc_high_line_resize.jpg)

I'm an engineering researcher focused on making robust and interpretable machine learning models. I have lead several fundamental research contributions related to the now well-known "adversarial examples phenomenon", affecting the responsible deployment of deep learning models in performance critical applications (e.g autonomous driving, making medical decisions). 

Outside work I enjoy traveling, cycling, and sailing (from windsurfing and dinghys to tall-ships and everything in between).
