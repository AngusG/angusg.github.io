# Introduction

*Despite what you may have been led to believe, the __purpose__ or __problem description__ is not to "develop deep knowledge" or "learn how to use the software". The purpose is a specific, attainable, quantifiable goal, in terminology appropriate for the field, but that one of your peers not taking the class could be reasonably expected to understand. A generic example is provided below, while the notation __ENGG*4420__ is used to suggest examples for the Real Time course. Some examples have been reproduced or adapted from previous reports with permission.*

$$
\begin{align*}
  & \phi(x,y) = \phi \left(\sum_{i=1}^n x_ie_i, \sum_{j=1}^n y_je_j \right)
  = \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n x_i y_j \phi(e_i, e_j) = \\
  & (x_1, \ldots, x_n) \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
      \phi(e_1, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_1, e_n) \\
      \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
      \phi(e_n, e_1) & \cdots & \phi(e_n, e_n)
    \end{array} \right)
  \left( \begin{array}{c}
      y_1 \\
      \vdots \\
      y_n
    \end{array} \right)
\end{align*}
$$

$$
\begin{equation} \label{eq:softmax}
	y_i = \frac{exp(z_i)}{\sum\limits_j exp(z_j)}	
\end{equation}
$$

The quotient rule is applied to \eqref{eq:softmax} to obtain the gradient, $\pdv{y_i}{z_j}$, for the case when $$j = i$$. Given that, $\pdv{\sum_j exp(z_j)}{z_j} = exp(z_i)$, and not labeling equations corresponding to intermediate steps, $\pdv{y_i}{z_j}$ can be evaluated as:

\begin{equation} 
	\frac{\partial{y_i}}{\partial{z_i}} = \frac{ exp(z_i) \cdot \sum_j exp(z_j) - exp(z_i) \cdot exp(z_i) }{ \big({\sum_j exp(z_j)}\big)^2}
\end{equation}
