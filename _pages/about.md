My research aims to identify properties of deep neural networks (DNNs) that
confer generalization and robustness to distribution shift. I believe that understanding
the information-theoretic limitations of [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
is a key step to these ends, and may help establish predictive performance guarantees
for safety-critical settings.

My research interests are motivated by the
â€œ[adversarial examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.6199)" phenomenon,
whereby artificial intelligence (AI) models may be fooled by input manipulations
that are deemed by many humans to be imperceptible or irrelevant. Adversarial
examples highlight confirmation biases associated with common characterizations
of representation learning in DNNs. For example the contribution
of visually salient natural image features to categorical predictions may be
over-estimated.

As part of my broader interest in trustworthy AI systems, I believe that more
systematic ethical oversight of AI research is required to maintain trust in the
field, and to ensure that respect for ([often digitized](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053951716650211))
persons remains at the forefront. Beyond my primary research objectives, I maintain
a keen passion for applied AI projects that have the potential for positive
social and/or environmental impacts.
