I’m interested in machine learning theory, so that models can be deployed
with confidence in practice.
This has led me to take an inter-disciplinary approach, bridging
information theory, statistical physics, and elements of electrical and computer engineering.

My current research interests are motivated by the “adversarial examples" problem,
which limits opportunities for the responsible deployment of deep learning models
in performance critical settings, e.g., commercial autopilots, or health care.
More generally, I am interested in representation learning, and causal modeling.

Personal interests include electronics, traveling, cycling,
and sailing.
