I am to understand the principles of deep neural network generalization and
robustness to distribution shift, so that models may be deployed with relevant
performance guarantees. I'm particularly interested in the application of
information theory to deep learning in the service of Engineering standards
and best practices.

My research interests are motivated by the â€œadversarial examples"
phenomenon, whereby models can be fooled by seemingly unimportant input
manipulations. This phenomenon poses a challenge to traditional interpretations
of features extracted by deep neural networks, and limits their use in the
sciences and performance-critical settings.

Toward trustworthy machine learning and artificial intelligence, I
believe that more systematic ethical oversight is required to maintain the
privilege of self-regulation, trust in the field, and ultimately that the
public interest remains at the forefront of our research.
