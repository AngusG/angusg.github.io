I work on deep learning theory and methodology, so that models can be
deployed with useful performance guarantees in practice. I'm particularly
interested in the application of information theory to deep learning, and in the
service of Engineering standards for its use.

My current research interests are motivated by the â€œadversarial examples"
phenomenon, which limits opportunities for the responsible deployment of deep
learning models in performance-critical settings, e.g., commercial autopilots,
or medical imaging. More generally, I am interested in privacy and security,
causal discovery, and embedded systems.
