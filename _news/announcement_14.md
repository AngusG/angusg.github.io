Submitted [Bounding generalization error with input compression: An empirical study with infinite-width networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09408)
to [Transactions on Machine Learning Research](https://jmlr.org/tmlr/). A great
collaboration between the Guelph MLRG and Anna Golubeva (MIT/IAIFI),
Mihai Nica (Guelph/Math & Stats), and Yani Ioannou (UCalgary).
We show how to lessen the need for a train/validation/test split by training
models to compress the training set, strengthening the connection between mutual
information and DNN generalization.
