New journal article [Predicting dreissenid mussel abundance in nearshore waters using underwater imagery and deep learning](http://doi.org/10.1002/lom3.10483 )
resulting from my collaboration with Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC)
was published in *Limnology and Oceanography: Methods*.
I presented the work at the [SOLE'22](https://iaglr.org/sol/sole22/) conference,
and it was featured in [UGuelph News](https://news.uoguelph.ca/2022/05/researchers-bringing-ai-smarts-to-monitor-for-invasive-great-lakes-mussels/)
as well as [Great Lakes Now](https://www.greatlakesnow.org/2022/05/ai-technology-invaders-great-lakes/).
